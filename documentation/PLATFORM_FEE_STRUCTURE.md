# LEAG Platform Fee Structure

> **Document Purpose:** Revenue sharing model between LEAG (platform) and tenant organizations
> **Last Updated:** December 17, 2025

## Overview

LEAG is a multi-tenant SaaS platform serving youth sports organizations. This document outlines the fee structure for tenant organizations using the platform, with special terms for founding partners.

**Key Clarification:** "Active users" in this document refers to **platform tenants** (organizations using LEAG), not end-users within a tenant's application (parents, players, etc.).

## Base Fee Schedule

| Revenue Type | Platform Fee | Notes |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| **Event Registrations** | 20% | Tryouts, camps, tournaments, open gyms |
| **Dues / Subscriptions** | 10% | Monthly/seasonal membership fees |
| **Third-Party Shop Products** | 10% | Merch from external designers/suppliers |
| **Custom Printify Products** | 10% | Tenant's custom-designed merch (see royalty model below) |

All fees are calculated on **gross revenue**, not profit.

---

## Designer Royalty Model (Custom Printify Products)

For tenants commissioning custom merchandise designs:

### Payment Structure

1. **Upfront Design Fee:** $1,000 paid to designer per collection/drop
2. **Recovery Phase:** Tenant receives 100% of net revenue (after platform fee) until $1,000 recovered
3. **Royalty Phase:** After recovery, designer receives 5% royalty per sale

### Example Flow

```
Product Price: $40
Platform Fee (10%): $4
Designer Royalty (5%, after recovery): $2
Tenant Revenue: $34 (during recovery) → $32 (after recovery)
```

### Profit Margin Guidelines

- Target retail markup: **35-40% profit margin** on cost
- Example: $25 cost item → $40 retail price (~38% margin)

## Fee Reduction Model (Platform Tenant Scaling)

Tenants receive reduced platform fees based on the number of **active platform tenants** (not end-users):

| Active Tenants | Fee Reduction | Event Fee | Dues Fee | Shop Fee |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|----------|----------|
| 1 (baseline) | 0% | 20% | 10% | 10% |
| 2 | -0.5% | 19.5% | 9.5% | 9.5% |
| 3 | -1.0% | 19% | 9% | 9% |
| 4 | -1.5% | 18.5% | 8.5% | 8.5% |
| 5 | -2.0% | 18% | 8% | 8% |
| 10 | -4.5% | 15.5% | 5.5% | 5.5% |
| 15 | -7.0% | 13% | 5% + $0.30 | 5% + $0.30 |
| 20+ | -9.5% | 10.5% | 5% + $0.30 | 5% + $0.30 |
| 34+ | Floor | 5% + $0.30 | 5% + $0.30 | 5% + $0.30 |

### Floor Rate
**5% + $0.30 per transaction** (competitive with full-service platforms)

### How It Works
- Fee reduction of **0.5% per active platform tenant**
- Reduction continues until floor is reached
- All tenants benefit equally from platform growth
- Encourages referrals and platform adoption

## In-Person Payment Collection

LEAG supports in-person payment collection via:
- **Tap to Pay** (NFC via Stripe Terminal / Tap to Pay on iPhone)
- **QR Code** payment links

### Use Cases

1. **Drop-in Event Payments** - Walk-up registrations paid on the spot
2. **Product Handoff Confirmation** - Pre-paid orders confirmed at delivery
3. **Coach-Delivered Products** - Skip online checkout, pay at handoff

In-person payments follow the same fee structure as online payments.

## Founding Partner Terms

NJ Stars Elite AAU is the founding tenant and proof-of-concept for LEAG.

### Special Considerations
- Platform built at no upfront cost to founding partner
- Fees may be negotiated based on:
  - Referral of new tenants to the platform
  - Reaching specific payout milestones to platform developers
  - Long-term partnership commitment

### Fee Reduction Incentives
- Each referred tenant that signs up reduces fees for all tenants
- Active participation in platform development/feedback valued

## Industry Comparison

| Platform | Transaction Fee | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| **LEAG (at scale)** | 5% + $0.30 | Floor rate with 30+ tenants |
| **Stripe** | 2.9% + $0.30 | Payment processing only |
| **Square** | 2.6% + $0.10 | Payment processing only |
| **TeamSnap** | ~3-5% | Includes team management |
| **LeagueApps** | 5-7% | Full platform fee |

LEAG's floor rate is competitive with full-service sports platforms while providing comprehensive features.

- **Scaling:** -0.5% per platform tenant
- **Floor:** 5% + $0.30 (matches Stripe)
