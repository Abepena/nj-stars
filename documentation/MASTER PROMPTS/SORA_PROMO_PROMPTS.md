Here are prompts organized by tool and content type:

## Sora / Veo 2 Prompts

**Hype Video (15-30 sec)**
```
Dynamic basketball highlight reel style video. Start with a basketball spinning in slow motion against a dark background with dramatic lighting. Transition to fast cuts of youth basketball action - dribbling, shooting, teamwork moments. Energy builds throughout. Colors: black, gold, and white. Cinematic sports broadcast quality. End with logo reveal emerging from basketball texture. No text overlay needed.
```

**Logo Reveal**
```
Basketball court at night, dramatic overhead lighting creating long shadows. Camera pushes in slowly on center court. A basketball bounces into frame and rolls to center, stopping perfectly. As it stops, the floor illuminates revealing a team logo. Dust particles float in the light beams. Cinematic, premium sports branding feel. 5 seconds.
```

**Community/Heart Version**
```
Warm documentary style footage of youth basketball. Golden hour lighting in a gymnasium. Slow motion moments: high-fives between young players, coach kneeling to talk to team, parents cheering from bleachers, players laughing during practice. Genuine, heartfelt, emphasizing community and growth over competition. Soft focus backgrounds, natural colors.

## Runway Gen-3 (Image-to-Video)

If you upload a team photo:
```
Add subtle cinematic motion: players shift weight slightly, jerseys ripple as if from movement, dramatic lighting flickers like arena lights. Camera slowly pushes in. Atmosphere of anticipation before a big game. 4 seconds.
```

If you upload your logo:
```
Logo emerges from darkness with basketball texture morphing into final design. Subtle particle effects like arena dust in spotlights. Confident, premium reveal. Gold accent lighting catches edges of the logo. 3 seconds.
```

If you upload a website screenshot:
```
Smooth scroll-through animation of website, slight 3D parallax depth effect on elements. Cursor gracefully navigates to registration button and clicks. Modern tech product launch style. Clean, professional. 5 seconds.
```

## Social-Specific (Instagram Reels / TikTok)

**Announcement Format**
```
Vertical 9:16 format. Quick cuts synced to beat drops: basketball bounce, sneaker squeak, swish through net, crowd reaction, logo hit. Text overlays appear with impact: "NEW ERA" / "NEW HOME" / "NJ STARS ELITE" / "LAUNCHING NOW". High energy, gen-z sports content style. 8 seconds, loops cleanly.
```

**Teaser/Countdown**
```
Vertical format. Single basketball on dark court, spotlight from above. Ball starts bouncing on its own, each bounce more energetic. Text counts down: 3... 2... 1... Final bounce transforms into logo explosion with gold particles. Suspenseful then celebratory. 6 seconds.
```

## Text Overlays to Add in Post (CapCut/Canva)

Since AI video generators handle text inconsistently, plan to add these in editing:

- "A New Home for NJ Stars Elite"
- "Register Now → njstarselite.com"
- "The Future of AAU Basketball in Jersey"
- "Where Champions Are Made"
- "Now Live 🏀"

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Generate 3-4 clips** in Sora using the hype and logo reveal prompts
2. **Pull them into CapCut** (free, great for this)
3. **Add text overlays**, your actual logo as PNG, and a hype music track
4. **Export versions** for:
   - Instagram Reel (9:16, 15-30 sec)
   - Facebook post (1:1 or 16:9, same content)
   - Website hero background (16:9, no text, loops)
