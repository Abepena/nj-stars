## Bug Fixes

### Event Registration Modal - Auth Token Fix
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/event-registration-modal.tsx`

**Issue:** Registration form showed "Authentication credentials were not provided" error because:
- Frontend was looking for `session.accessToken` (doesn't exist)
- Frontend was using `Bearer` prefix instead of `Token`

**Fix:**
- Changed `accessToken` → `apiToken` (what `auth.ts` actually stores)
- Changed `Bearer ${token}` → `Token ${token}` (Django TokenAuthentication format)

---

### Product QuickView - Image Index Preservation
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/product-quick-view.tsx`

**Issue:** Switching colors reset the image gallery to index 0, even if the new color had enough images to show the current index.

**Fix:**
- Extracted `getImagesForColor()` helper function
- Modified useEffect to only reset index if `currentImageIndex >= newColorImages.length`
- Preserves user's position when switching between colors with equal image counts


---

### Events Page - Infinite Loop Fix
**Files:** `frontend/src/app/events/page.tsx`

**Issue:** "Maximum update depth exceeded" error when loading the events page with calendar view.

**Root Cause:** 
- `selectedDayEvents` was computed fresh on every render (new array reference)
- This was in the useEffect dependency array, causing React to re-run the effect each render
- Effect called `setMapFocusedEvents()` which triggered parent re-render -> infinite loop

**Fix:**
1. Memoized `selectedDayEvents` with `useMemo(() => ..., [selectedDate, events])`
2. Created stable `handleDateSelect` callback with `useCallback`
3. Replaced inline `onDateSelect` function with the memoized callback


---


---

### Calendar Date Position - Top-Right Alignment  
**Files:** `frontend/src/app/events/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Date numbers were positioned at top-left of calendar cells.

**Fix:**
- Added `flex flex-col` to calendar cell button
- Added `self-end` to date number div to align to right side

---

### Map - Show Only Selected Day's Events
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/event-map.tsx`

**Issue:** Map showed all events regardless of calendar day selection.

**Fix:**
- Changed `mappableEvents` to only show `focusedEvents` (selected day's events)
- When no day selected, shows default location (NJ Stars practice facility) with no markers
- Updated DEFAULT_CENTER to 75 Stivers Street, Cresskill, NJ (40.9415, -73.9585)
- Added DEFAULT_ZOOM constant for consistent zoom on default view
- Legend now hidden when no events are displayed

## Backend API Enhancements

### Events API - Full CRUD Support
**Files:** `backend/apps/events/views.py`, `backend/apps/events/serializers.py`

**Before:** `ReadOnlyModelViewSet` (GET only)
**After:** `ModelViewSet` with full CRUD + custom actions

**New Endpoints:**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/events/` | Create new event |
| PUT/PATCH | `/api/events/{slug}/` | Update event |
| DELETE | `/api/events/{slug}/` | Delete event |
| POST | `/api/events/{slug}/duplicate/` | Clone event |
| POST | `/api/events/{slug}/toggle_registration/` | Open/close registration |
| POST | `/api/events/{slug}/toggle_public/` | Publish/unpublish |

**Permissions:**
- List/Retrieve: `AllowAny` (public events only for anonymous users)
- Create/Update/Delete: `IsStaffMember` required
- Staff sees ALL events including drafts

---

### New Permission Class
**Files:** `backend/apps/portal/permissions.py`

Added `IsAdminUser` permission class:
- Checks `user.is_superuser`, `user.is_staff`, or `user.profile.role == 'admin'`
- For admin-only operations (full CRUD on sensitive data)

---

## Frontend Admin Pages

### Events Management Page (NEW)

- `frontend/src/app/portal/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/portal/dashboard/admin/printify/page.tsx`
- `frontend/src/app/portal/dashboard/layout.tsx`

**Goal:** Consolidate Printify management into the Admin Dashboard instead of a separate page.

**Changes:**
1. **Created `PrintifyAdminSection` component** - Collapsible card that:
   - Shows "Printify Store" header with product count badge
   - Lazy-loads products when first expanded (reduces initial load)
   - "Sync from Printify" button to import products
   - "Open Printify Dashboard" external link

2. **Created `collapsible.tsx` UI component** - Wrapper for `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`
   - Installed `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` package
   - Exports `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, `CollapsibleContent`

3. **Updated Admin Dashboard** - Added `<PrintifyAdminSection />` after Quick Actions

4. **Replaced standalone Printify page** - Now redirects to `/portal/dashboard/admin`

5. **Removed Printify from sidebar** - No longer a separate navigation item

**UX Improvement:** Admins now have all management tools in one dashboard view instead of navigating to separate pages.

## Calendar UI Fix

### Date Number Alignment

**Fix:** Removed `mx-auto md:mx-0` from the date number div class

---


---

## Map Enhancements

### Map Zoom to Selected Calendar Day
**Files:** `frontend/src/app/events/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/components/event-map.tsx`

**Feature:** When a user clicks a day on the calendar, the map now zooms to show events for that day.

**Implementation:**
- Added `focusedEvents={mapFocusedEvents}` prop to both mobile and desktop EventMap components
- `onDateSelect` callback from CalendarView passes selected day's events to state
- EventMap uses `useEffect` to pan/zoom when `focusedEvents` changes
- Single event: zooms to location and opens InfoWindow
- Multiple events: fits bounds to show all event markers
- No selection: resets to show all events on map

---

### Multiple Events at Same Location
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/event-map.tsx`

**Feature:** Handle multiple events that share the same venue/coordinates with a navigation selector.

**Implementation:**
- Added `LocationGroup` interface to group events by coordinates
- `getLocationKey()` rounds lat/lng to 4 decimal places (~10m tolerance)
- Markers show event count badge when multiple events share location
- InfoWindow includes prev/next navigation arrows with "X of Y events" indicator
- Cycling through events updates the selected event and notifies parent

**New UI Elements:**
- Count badge on markers (e.g., "3" for 3 events at location)
- Navigation header in InfoWindow: `< 1 of 3 events >`
- White stroke on multi-event markers for visual distinction

## Map UI Enhancements

### Home Base Default Location
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/event-map.tsx`

**Feature:** Map defaults to NJ Stars Practice Facility when no events are selected.

**Implementation:**
- Added `HOME_BASE` constant with coordinates for 75 Stivers Street, Cresskill, NJ
- Created pink star marker icon for home location
- InfoWindow shows facility name, address, and "Get Directions" button
- Map centers on home base on initial load and when no day is selected

### Map Position and Auto-Toggle
**Files:** `frontend/src/app/events/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Map moved below calendar** - Map now appears after the CalendarView instead of above it
2. **Auto-toggle on selection** - Map automatically shows when a calendar day with events is selected

**Implementation:**
```tsx
// Auto-toggle map when events are selected
useEffect(() => {
  if (mapFocusedEvents.length > 0) {
    setShowMap(true)
  }
}, [mapFocusedEvents])
```

### InfoWindow Visibility Fix
**Files:** `frontend/src/components/event-map.tsx`

**Issue:** InfoWindow popups were sometimes cut off at the top of the map view.

**Fix:** Added pan offset when showing markers to ensure InfoWindow is fully visible:
- Single event: `lat - 0.003` offset positions marker lower, leaving room for InfoWindow above
- Multiple events: `{ top: 150, ... }` padding in `fitBounds` for InfoWindow space

---

## Notes for Tomorrow

1. ~~**Map Zoom Feature** - ✅ Completed (zoom to selected day's events)~~
2. ~~**Multiple Events at Location** - ✅ Completed (prev/next navigation in InfoWindow)~~
3. ~~**Roster Admin Page** - ✅ Completed~~
4. ~~**Check-Ins Admin Page** - ✅ Completed~~
5. ~~**Registrations Admin Page** - ✅ Completed~~
6. **Backend API Endpoints** - Need to create `/api/portal/admin/roster/`, `/api/portal/admin/check-ins/`, `/api/portal/admin/registrations/` endpoints
7. **React Query Setup** - Consider adding for better data fetching in admin pages
8. **Event Form Enhancements** - Consider adding address autocomplete using Google Maps integration
9. **Test Admin Pages** - Verify all admin pages work with real API data

---

        ("6th", "6th Grade"), ("7th", "7th Grade"), ("8th", "8th Grade"),
        ("hs", "High School"), ("elite", "Elite"),
    ]
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
